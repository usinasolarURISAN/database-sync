# Usage

## PM2

`pm2 start pm2-start.bash --name database-sync`

## CSV Syncing

> Use branch `csv-update` and change the csv to be updated, after that run `ts:prd` to start syncing registers.

1. The csv/test.csv is the file used to update data by default.
2. You will only find csv/test.csv once `test.csv.zip` is extracted to the base path.
